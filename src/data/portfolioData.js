    bio: [
      'Product Management is where my passion for innovation, strategic execution, and user-centered design converge. I\'ve built my career on solving complex operational challenges and translating them into scalable, intuitive products that drive measurable business impact.',
      'At Aptive Environmental, I serve as a Product Manager leading the development of Aspyn, a multi-tenant, microservice-based platform that powers field operations, routing, scheduling, licensing, and compliance for one of the largest pest control companies in the U.S. I spearheaded the creation of our in-house routing optimization engine (ARO), which improved operational efficiency by increasing appointments per gallon from 1.5 to 2.0 and reducing fleet travel time by 23%. I also defined and delivered a dedicated routing and scheduling UI that gave operations leaders unprecedented visibility into routes, appointments, and technician shifts—resulting in $2M in annual cost savings.',
      'Beyond routing, I launched a licensing and compliance platform to ensure EPA and state regulatory adherence, significantly reducing audit risk and streamlining technician credential management. I also established data-driven dashboards for managers, enabling real-time KPI tracking, performance monitoring, and proactive compliance oversight.',
      'My background in UX/UI design continues to shape my approach as a Product Manager. Having run a freelance design business, I learned the importance of uncovering real user pain points, validating solutions through usability testing, and creating experiences that feel both seamless and powerful. That foundation now informs my product philosophy: every decision must be grounded in empathy, data, and measurable outcomes.',
      'Today, I thrive at the intersection of technology, operations, and user experience—driving products that deliver strategic business value while making complex workflows intuitive for end users.'

Despite being a passion project, Deli Dash taught us valuable lessons about product-market fit, iteration speed, and the importance of getting real user feedback early.',
